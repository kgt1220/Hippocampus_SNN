## A spiking neural network model of the hippocampus - simulating memory competition through selective inhibition

This repository contains the code accompanying the bioRxiv preprint: [Selective inhibition in CA3: A mechanism for stable pattern completion through heterosynaptic plasticity](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.16.608240)

#Instructions to Run the Code:
1. Prepare the dataset:
Run Prepare_Whole_data.ipynb to generate the dataset.

4. Simulate the model:
Run Simulation_10_inputs.ipynb to simulate the model with any set of 10 input patterns.

3. Plot the results:
You can generate various figures using the Plot_*.ipynb files.
